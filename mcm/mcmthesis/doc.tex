Energy is an important support of modern economy. In our paper, we construct a model defining the four-state energy compact integrating variables to process data, and succeed in characterizing the engergy profile by proportion and growth rate.\\
First, we integrate variables and make engergy profile shown as an area chart. We develop Energy Profile Model composed of Energy Proportion Model and Growth Rate Model.To obtain the proportion of energy in each state over time, we further simplify variables to fossil fuels energy, renewable energy and nuclear energy. After using sinusoidal model to fit cures, we get the function expressions between prportion and time. We use Moving Average in Time Series to get 1963-2007 energy consumption. We establish Growth Rate Model in similar way.\\
Next, we choose sector (industry，commerce and
residential industries) and population to discuss influential factors of the similarities and differences about the four states’ usage of cleaner, renewable energy sources. Thus we define the impact factor.The similarity is that the ratio of impact factors of AZ, NM, TX is $ 3.412 : 1 : 1 $. We use the IPAT formula and the revised ”Laspeyres” exponential decomposition method to analyze the impact of population growth.\\
Then, we select the average price, import expenditure size and size of productivity of power as the evaluation criteria. And use analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to determine their weights. In 2009, Texas had the "best" have the “best” profile for use of cleaner, renewable energy whose total sort weight is 0.4043. We give two kinds of predictive values of the energy profile of each state for 2025 and 2050 based on two models.\\
Finally, we state that the average price of electricity should be set at about 28.26 dollars in 2025 and 34.97 dollars in 2050 as the goal for this new four-state energy compact.
We discuss three actions the four states might take to meet their energy
compact goals.

\section{Memo}
To: The group of Governors From: Team \# 89307 Date: 12 February \\Subject: A Four-State Energy Compact\\
%summarizing the state profiles as of 2009,
%your predictions with regard to energy usage absent any policy changes, and your recommended
%goals for the energy compact to adopt.
Our team has summarized the state profiles as of 2009. Mathematical models are built to illustrate it.\\
In each state, the growth of energy consumption keeps the energy structure from small to large scale, with the proportion of cleaner, renewable energy sources increasing.\\
In New Mexico(the smallest energy consumption), oil and petroleum products, coal and natural gas are the main component.\\
In Texas(the largest energy consumption), oil and petroleum products and natural gas have always dominated. The proportion of biomass and wind energy is very low.\\
We predict the energy consumption of four states by Energy Proportion Model and Growth Rate Model. 
By Energy Proportion Model, the total energy consumption of AZ in 2025 is 2320000, of which 9.4\% is Renewable energy. The most states' proportion of renewable energy is 8\% in 2025.
By Growth Rate Model, the most states' proportion of renewable energy is 9\%.
When it is 2050, the former is 12\%(excluding the data of AZ) while the latter is 11\%.\\
So the results of our models can be referred.
And we find the average price of electricity of the four states in 2025 and 2050 are 35.32732299 and 43.71283002 based on our models.
Therefore, the average price of the four states in 2025 should be set at about 28.26(80\% of the predictive values absent any policy changes) dollars.\\
In 2050 the average price should be set at about 34.97(80\% of the predictive values absent any policy changes) dollars. We state it as the goal for this new four-state energy compact.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Restatement of the Problem}
Energy is an important support of modern economy. It turns to be the material basis for the survival of human society, and it plays an indispensable role in promoting the economic and social development.\cite{energy} 
With the economic development and fast population growth，the demand for energy grows larger and larger，energy consumption increases substantially，and the traditional energy resources decline day by day，which can not meet the needs of economic development. So the United States in need of new energy to satisfy the increasingly growing demands for energy consumption，in addition，it can construct environmentally friendly country. \\
There are four states – California (CA), Arizona(AZ), New Mexico (NM), and Texas (TX) – that wish to form a realistic new energy compact focused on increased usage of cleaner, renewable energy sources. \\
We need to provide an energy profile for each of the four states using the data given and develop a model to describe how the energy profile. Then we are required to address the results of our model to provide a concise description for the similarities and differences between the four states.We also should select the credible criteria to determine the 'best' profile for usage of cleaner, renewable energy in 2009 and predict the energy profile of each state for 2025 and 2050 in the absence of policy based on the historical development and our understanding of the profile.\\
Then we are supposed to determine renewable energy usage for 2025 and 2050 and necessary actions to meet the goals for new renewable energy compact. Finally, we should prepare a memo to the group of Governors summarizing the state profiles.

\section{Assumptions and Notions}
\subsection{General Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We mainly consider the consumption of fossil fuels, renewable energy and nuclear ernergy. At the same time, we consider the proportion of fossil fuels, renewable energy and nuclear energy.
	\item We do not consider energy loss such as the loss of  electricity system and co-product fuel ethanol when calculating renewable energy costs because of lack of price data.
	\item We assume that the electricity is often consumed in time, and the electricity stored in the battery will be consumed by the commercial sectoer.
	\item We do not take the electricity producted from fossil fuels into consideration because we do not know the efficiency of the conversion of various of fossil fuels into electricity.
	\item We consider various types of renewable energy,  nuclear energy will be converted into electricity.
	\item We approximate the sum of renewable energy production，electricity produced from nuclear energy，net imports of electricity into the United States and net interstate sales of electricity and associated losses (negative and positive values) as electricity total consumption.
	\item When considering the proportion of various of energy, we mainly focus on fossil fuel energy, renewable energy and nuclear energy because there is an overlap between electricity consumption and the energy described above.
	\item We ignore the impact of the world energy reserves and trade patterns.

\section{Energy Profile Model}
In this section, we derive a model to characterize how the energy profile of each of the four states has evolved from 1960 – 2009, called the energy profile model. Specially, we state total energy consumption as the sum of fossil fuels energy, renewable energy and nuclear energy.
\subsection{Integrat variables}
First, we address the data according to the integrity and redundancy of the information. We divide energy into 4 major categories and 11 minor categories like what displayed in \autoref{tab:bianliang}. 
Then, we analyze the 50 years of data in 11 variables on each of these four states’ energy production and consumption. 
Since all forms of energy tend to eventually be converted into electricity, we temporarily ignore the effects of electricity imports and exports. To simplify the problem, we ignore trade between each state in the United States too. Fuel ethanol, wood and waste are partially coincidental with biomass.So we choose biomass as a representative. \\

\end{table}
%https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/sep_use/notes/use_a.pdf
Note: $ PMTCB  $ represents all petroleum products total consumption excluding fuel ethanol.\\
Note: we only use data from the provided excel table and that mentioned in the pdf file.
\begin{align}
FFTCB &= CLTCB + NNTCB + PMTCB\\
PMTCB &= PATCB - EMTCB
\end{align}
However, after screening the data, we found that, judging from the order of magnitude difference, fuel ethanol(excluding denaturant) accounts for a very small percentage of fossil fuels.The maximum was produced in California in 2009, but not more than 1.5\%.(AZ:1.48\%,CA: 1.37\%,NM: 0.51\%,TX: 0.64\%)At the same time, we found loss of the cost of all petroleum products total consumption excluding fuel ethanol.
Therefore, we use $ PATCB $ rather than $ PMTCB $ in \autoref{eq:shiyoudaiti}.
\begin{align}
FFTCB \approx CLTCB + NNTCB + PATCB\label{eq:shiyoudaiti}

We analyze the data and use energy consumption as an indicator of energy profile in four states.\\
Then the energy configuration analysis we established is shown in \autoref{fig:mianjitu} as an area chart. (code seen in Appendix 1)\\

The four states has been ranked from low to high according to the total energy consumption.
\begin{itemize}
	\item In New Mexico, oil and petroleum products, coal and natural gas are the main component.New Mexico's total energy consumption is the least in the four states.
	\item In Arizona, fossil fuels have always dominated, still accounting for well over half in 2009.Although there are fluctuations, hydroelectricity and biomass have been to maintain a certain amount of consumption.
	\item In California, oil and petroleum products and natural gas also are the main component. California's energy is diverse, whose energy consumption structure include hydroelectricity, biomass, wind energy, and geothermal.
	\item In Texas, oil and petroleum products and natural gas have always dominated.The proportion of biomass and wind energy is very low.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Analysis Model}
\subsubsection{Energy Proportion Model}
Because electricity is often consumed in time, the electricity stored in the batteries will be consumed by the business. And fossil fuels energy, various types of renewable energy (except biomass, mainly fuel ethanol) and nuclear energy will be converted into electricity,
we choose fossil fuels energy, renewable energy and nuclear energy to address data. \\
Through the analysis and integration of the data, we get the proportion of fossil fuels energy, renewable energy and nuclear energy in each state over time as shown in \autoref{fig:fenbutu}.\\

\end{figure}
Let the proportion of energy be $ P(t) $.
We set the proportion of fossil fuels energy, renewable energy and nuclear energy as $  P_{FF}(t) $, $ P_{RE}(t) $ and $  P_{NE}(t) $.\\
Based on \autoref{eq:shiyoudaiti}, we give the conditions as follows:
\begin{numcases}{}
P_{FF}(t)+P_{RE}(t)+P_{NE}(t)=1,\notag \\
P_{FF}(t)\geqslant 0,\notag\\
P_{RE}(t)\geqslant 0,\notag\\
P_{NE}(t)\geqslant 0.
\end{numcases}
Thus, we can figure out $P(t)$. 
By using sinusoidal model to fit, we get the function expressions between prportion and time.
R-square List = [0.855, 0.8152, 0.8767, 0.9611, 0.8417, 0.2596, 0.8203, 0.6865, 0.7012, 0.9439, 0.8733] (code seen in Appendix 2)Most of R-squares are more than 0.8152, so the fuction $P(t)$ determined by sinusoidal model is very reasonable.\\
According to the proportion model, the proportion of fossil fuels in CA,NM and TX is stable over time, while AZ’s has a large fluctuation and instability.\\
When considering renewable energy, the volatility of renewable energy in AZ is large while CA’s is stable. In nearly six years, the proportion of renewable energy in NM and TX is gradually increasing, which show steady increasement of the renewable energy development momentum.\\
Nuclear energy accounted for basic stability over time, and has showed a trend of growth. The followings are the fitting formulas for the three types of energy proportion under the influence of policy, economic cycle and other factors.\\

	\end{align}
	\item Renewable Energy\\
	\begin{multline}

	\begin{multline}

	\end{align}
\end{itemize}
Note:Because there is no nuclear power plant in NM, we think its nuclear energy proportion is always zero.
\subsubsection{Growth Rate Model}
For a given state, we describe the state's energy development by defining variables for growth rates.\\
Now define the concept of growth rate, set the growth rate $ v $ as a function of year(time).\\
\begin{align}
v(t)=\dfrac{c(t)-c(t-1)}{c(t-1)}
\end{align}
We use Moving Average in Time Series to get 1963-2007 energy consumption called $ c(t) $\cite{mova}, whose goal is to eliminate stochastic disturbances and year-to-year interactions. And we take the real consumption called $ \mathit{rc} $ from the excel table.\\
\begin{align}
c(t)=\dfrac{\sum_{i=t-2}^{t+2}\mathit{rc(t)}}{N}(N=5),\qquad i\geq 3
\end{align}


Thus, we can figure out $ v(t) $. By using sinusoidal model to fit, we get the function expressions between growth rate and time. Most of R-squares are more than 0.653, so the fuction $  v(t) $ determined by sinusoidal model vis very reasonable.(code seen in appendices 3)

It can be seen from the figure above that the consumption of renewable energy has a cyclical change over time, but it has shown a significant upward in the past 10 years in NM and TX. 
\subsubsection{Influential Factors of the similarities and differences}
According to our energy profile model and the data provided, we select industry and population as influential factors to analyze the similarities and differences about usage of cleaner, renewable energy sources between the four states. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sector\\
	The similarities and differences between the four states can be seen from the degree of demand for energy consumption in various industries.\\ To determine the industrial factors over time, we chose the industry，commerce and residential industries. For the transportation industry, after analyzing the data, the impact on renewable energy is negligible. The largest proportion in CA is 1.34\%, considering the contribution rate, we ignore it.\\
	We give the definition of the impact factor. Since the energy consumption of each year is known, and we assume that the impact factor is a function of time $ Q_{1}(t) $, $ Q_{2}(t) $, $ Q_{3}(t) $ are defined as the impact factor.
	\begin{gather}
	c_{1} \cdot Q_{1}(t)+c_{2} \cdot Q_{2}(t)+c_{3} \cdot Q_{3}(t)=\mathit{rc(t)}
	\end{gather}
	The similarity is that the ratio of impact factors of AZ, NM, TX called as $ Q_{1}(t) $, $ Q_{2}(t) $, $ Q_{3}(t) $ is $ 3.412:1:1 $.\\
	The difference is that the ratio of impact factors of CA states changes over time, with the attached illustrations of CA shown in \autoref{fig:Industry}.(code seen in Appendices 6)
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figure/Factorsofthesimilaritiesanddifferences}
		\caption{The impact factors of CA changes over time}
		\label{fig:Industry}
	\end{figure}
	\item Population\\
	We assume that the value of dollar is stable remain unchanged for several years(2000-2005).\\
	We use the IPAT formula and the revised "Laspeyres" exponential decomposition method to analyze the impact of population growth on total energy consumprtion gowth.\cite{IPAT}\\
	We take $ \Delta $ as the change from the end of the year to the beginning.\\
	In the model, $ \Delta TPOPP$ can represent the impact of population size on energy consumption.\\
	The population of these four states increases approximately linearly over time, and the rate of increase is positively correlated with their population base.
	\begin{align}
	\Delta TETCB&=TETCB_{t}-TETCB_{0}\notag\\&=\Delta TPOPP^{effects}+\Delta A^{effects}+\Delta TETGR^{effects}
	\end{align}
	\setlength\multlinegap{4em}
	\setlength\multlinetaggap{8em}
	\begin{multline}
	\Delta TPOPP^{effects}=\Delta TPOPP\cdot A_{0}\cdot TETGR_{0}\\
	+\frac{1}{2}\left ( \Delta TPOPP\cdot \Delta A\cdot TETGR_{0} \right ) \\
	+\frac{1}{2}\left ( \Delta TPOPP\cdot A_{0}\cdot \Delta TETGR \right )\\
	+ \frac{1}{3}\left ( \Delta TPOPP\cdot \Delta A\cdot \Delta TETGR \right)
	\end{multline}
	\begin{multline}
	\Delta A^{effects}= TPOPP_{0}\cdot \Delta A\cdot TETGR_{0}\\
	+\frac{1}{2}\left ( \Delta TPOPP\cdot \Delta A\cdot TETGR_{0} \right ) \\
	+\frac{1}{2}\left ( TPOPP_{0}\cdot \Delta A\cdot \Delta TETGR \right )\\
	+\frac{1}{3}\left ( \Delta TPOPP\cdot \Delta A\cdot \Delta TETGR \right )
	\end{multline}
	\begin{multline}
	\Delta TETGR^{effects}= TPOPP_{0}\cdot A_{0}\cdot \Delta TETGR\\
	+\frac{1}{2}\left ( TPOPP_{0}\cdot \Delta A\cdot \Delta TETGR \right )\\
	+\frac{1}{2}\left ( \Delta TPOPP\cdot A_{0}\cdot \Delta TETGR \right ) \\
	+\frac{1}{3}\left ( \Delta TPOPP\cdot \Delta A\cdot \Delta TETGR \right )
	\end{multline}	
	However, the disaggregation analysis structure based on the population scale model shows that the energy consumption growth in each state has great volatility in growth of population size.\\
	Positive effect shows that Americans have a lot of differences in energy usage. The peak $ \Delta TETCB $ far above 100\% between 1978 and 2009 can also reflect the wealth distribution of Americans. The energy consumption characteristics of high-income groups play a significant role in the overall energy consumption structure.\\
	After excluding the largest peak, we find that the increase in population size in AZ and CA has a negative effect on the increase in energy consumption while the increase in population size in NM and TX has a positive effect on the increase in energy consumption.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Criteria for the best Profile}
We select the appropriate indicators, establish an credible evaluation criteria to determine which of the four states appeared to have the “best” profile for use of cleaner, renewable energy in 2009.\\
Through the analysis of the data, we have integrated distribution in cleaner and renewable energy. Various types of renewable energy (except biomass, mainly fuel ethanol) and nuclear energy will be converted into electricity.
From the perspective of distribution, the share of electricity in the four states is the largest and more representative, so we choose the energy source of electricity as the basis for analysis.\\ Then we select the average price, import expenditure size, size of productivity as the evaluation criteria (they are highly correlated with energy efficiency) according to literature we view.\cite{evaluation}
In order to get the weight vector, we need to compute the weight of the
three factors.
Thus, we can figure out that the weight vector  $ B=\begin{bmatrix}
0.259&0.0653&0.6757
\end{bmatrix}  $.
Finally, in consistency check, the consistency index CI =  0.0098 < 0.10, which
means that the weight determined by AHP is very reasonable.\cite{AHP}(code seen in Appendix 7)
Therefore, we established the three criteria of paired comparison judgment matrix.\\

The largest total sort weight is in \textbf{TX} whose total sort weight is 0.4043. Therefore, TX has the “best” profile in 2009.

\subsubsection{Predict the energy profile of each state for 2025 and 2050}	
\begin{equation}
v^{-}(t) \leq v(t) \leq v^{+}(t)
\end{equation}
We address that $ v(t) $ cannot be in the range of 80\% to 100\% of the boundary value for many years based on the absence of policy.\\
Predictive Result by Energy Proportion Model and Growth Rate Model to predict the energy profile of each state, for 2025 and 2050 in the absence of any policy changes by each governor’s office.\\
After comparing the predictions of the two models, we find that the results based on Growth Rate Model are basically smaller than that based on Energy Proportion Model, and the difference will be greater when the prediction is further away. \\
This is because Growth Rate Model considers the cyclicality and volatility of the growth rate, and the cyclicality and volatility can lead to negative value of growth rate in some years while the total consumption used in Energy Proportion Model is approximately linear linearly proportional to time.
This inevitably leads to differences, and the longer the forecast year, the greater the difference. \\
We also find that the proportion of renewable energy in AZ was up to 33\%, and we believe that the proportion is obviously large, which may not be consistent with the actual situation.

\section{Energy Compact Model}
\subsection{Renewable Energy Usage Targets}Based on our discussion in Evaluation Criteria for the best Profile and above models, the average price of electricity in 2025 and 2050 respectively.\\
\autoref{predic} presents the predictive values of average price in 2025 and 2050. Find the average price of the four states in 2025 and 2050 are 35.32732299 and 43.71283002 based on the fit curves as shown in \autoref{fig:AvePrice}\\

Therefore, the average price of the four states in 2025 should be set at about 28.26(80\% of the predictive values absent any policy changes) dollars.\\
In 2050 the average price should be set at about 34.97(80\% of the predictive values absent any policy changes) dollars. We state it as the goal for this new four-state energy compact.\\ In order to establish Interstate Energy Price Contract for 2025 and 2050, we obtain the table by using the above two models, that is, Growth Rate Model and Energy Proportion Model. We predict the total consumption and the proportion of renewable energy in 2025 and 2050 from two kinds of ideas. It can be seen in \autoref{error} that the two models have small error of the simulation. The fact indicates that the two models are successful.\\

\subsection{Actions to meet the Energy Compact Goal}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Support clean coal technology.\\ According to our prediction model, the future fossil energy consumption of the United States is still very large, and the proportion of the total energy consumption is also large.  Therefore, in order to achieve the goal of the Western Interstate Energy Compact, namely to increase amount of usage of renewable energy and utilization ratio, states have to reduce the proportion of fossil fuel and increase the efficiency of usage of fossil fuels. Supporting clean coal technology can improve coal utilization and heat conversion efficiency. Such measures could effectively reduce fossil fuel's consumption.
	\item Support photovoltaic solar cell semiconductor materials research.\\ Since the U.S. will adopt a new energy plan, it will inevitably slow the development of renewable energy, which will have a negative impact on global climate change. Most of renewable energy production will not have a larger effect on the environment (except hydroelectricity industry), so continue to support the development of renewable energy is indispensable. However, most renewable energy depends on the natural conditions. Increasing the energy conversion rate of photovoltaic solar energy and reducing the cost of photovoltaic solar energy generation can make the production of this renewable energy source as environmentally-friendly as possible.
	\item Apply preferential policies to energy transactions between the states.\\ Lower the threshold of energy trade across the states, and strengthen the interstate commerce energy flow. In order to realize the Western Interstate Energy Contract and promote the cooperation among the states, states should reach an agreement on the interstate commerce of energy. States also should adopt preferential policies to deal with the interstate energy trade, especially the electricity trade generated from renewable energy production. And states should gradually coordinate their distributionof the renewable energy industry with other states according to their own geographical conditions and industrial needs. So that state's renewable energy efficiency ratio will be as low as possible.

\section{Strengths and weaknesses}
\subsection{Strength}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We use two models to predict the consumption of various energy sources in 2025 and 2050 from both the proportion and the growth rate of energy consumption. It  make up for the errors caused by some uncertain factors. We take the industrial development over time into account. At the same time, we consider that the consumption of various forms of energy will have a certain periodicity and volatility due to the influence of industry, environment, population, technology and other factors.
	\item The growth rate model adopts the method of moving average to define $ c(t) $, which eliminates some uncontrollable factors such as random errors of data records and the influence of the previous year on the following year.
	\item The population size decomposition model called IPAT quantifies the impact of population on clean energy.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Weakness}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Since the predictive value of Proportion Model depends on the total energy consumption, the linear fit of the total energy consumption less prime in the consideration of factors. It will make all kinds of energy consumption too large.	
	\item The two models in CA predict a larger error in the share of renewable energy in 2050.
	\item No sensitivity analysis was done in the evaluation Evaluation Criteria 
	\item Incomplete assumptions. There are claims that natural gas reserves in 2040 depletion.Our model does not consider the limited reserves.
	\item In this paper, the solution of the model is limited to the capacity of the computer, and it can't achieve higher accuracy.
	\item Our model cannot resolve the existence of information cascade (the most influential one is not always the best one) phenomena.
\end{itemize}
\section{Conclusions}
The energy configuration analysis we established is shown in \autoref{fig:mianjitu} as an area chart after integrat variables. The energy structure of each state has its own characteristics.In Arizona, fossil fuels have always dominated, still accounting for well over half in 2009. In Texas, the proportion of biomass and wind energy is very low.\\
Through Energy Proportion Model, we get the proportion of fossil fuels
energy, renewable energy and nuclear energy in each state over time as shown in \autoref{fig:fenbutu}.
We define the proportion of energy $ P(t) $. Similarly we obtain Growth Rate Model defining the proportion of energy  $ v(t) $.\\We choose industry and  population to discuss influential Factors of the similarities and differences about usage of cleaner, renewable energy sources between the four states. The similarity is that the ratio of impact factors of AZ, NM, TX called as $ Q_{1}(t) $, $ Q_{2}(t) $, $ Q_{3}(t) $ is $ 3.412:1:1 $.
The difference is that the ratio of impact factors of CA states changes over time, with the attached illustrations of CA shown in \autoref{fig:Industry}.\\
The population of four states increases approximately linearly over time. However, the disaggregation analysis structure based on the population scale model shows that the energy consumption growth in each state has great volatility in growth of population size.\\
We use analytical hierarchy process, abbreviated to AHP. Determine three indexes we choose-average price, import expenditure size, size of productivity of electricity as the evaluation criteria weights.The largest total sort weight is in TX whose total sort weight is 0.4043. In 2009, Texas had the "best" have the “best” profile for use of cleaner, renewable energy.\\
According to $ P(t) $ and  $ v(t) $ based on our models, we get the predictive value of the energy profile of each state for 2025 and 2050 as shown in \autoref{tab:ProPredict} and \autoref{tab:GroPredict}.\\
The average price of the four states in 2025 should be set at about 28.26(80\% of the predictive values absent any policy changes) dollars.\\
In 2050 the average price should be set at about 34.97(80\% of the predictive values absent any policy changes) dollars. We state it as the goal for this new four-state energy compact.
We discuss three actions the four states might take to meet their energy
compact goals.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Support clean coal technology.
	\item Support photovoltaic solar cell semiconductor materials research.
	\item Apply preferential policies to energy transactions between the states.
\end{itemize}
